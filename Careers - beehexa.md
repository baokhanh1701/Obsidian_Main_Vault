**POS (Point of sale)**: A POS system, or point-of-sale system, facilitates transactions in retail sales. An example of a well-known POS system would be a cash register. Modern POS systems are a combination of hardware and software that often includes a barcode scanner, card reader, cash drawer, and receipt printer. The customer interface is often a touchscreen. The simplest modern POS systems are a credit card scanner connected to a tablet.

**Customer relationship management (CRM)** is **a technology for managing all your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers**.
